## Security Vulnerability: Unvalidated Paddle Speed Input

**File:** main.py

**Description:**
The paddle_speed variable is set directly from sys.argv[1] without any validation. This allows users to input very large or negative values, which can cause unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Recommendation:**
Validate the input to ensure paddle_speed is within a safe, reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 20).
